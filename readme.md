# Infant breath mechanical simulator

This project is about developing, constructing and using a mechanical breathing simulator. This device can simulate air flows like normal or sick infant and can be used in laboratory conditions or Neonatal Intensive Care Units for further experimentation.


# Aims
- high volume and flow accuracy
- low construction cost and low tech modules
- easily modifiable for extensions (ex. child or adult volumes)

# Main modules
- The volume compartment consists of a calibration syringe
- The air flow is produced from a moving stepper motor
- Program and data are imported to arduino
- 3d printed parts are based on RepRap Prusa Interation 3

# Version 0.2
This is a beta version. Works on predifined settings but you may encounter problems while using new features or trying to modify functions. Some final touches are needed for software code to be smoothly used. 

# Contribution
This project started at Pediatric Pulmonology Department of University Hospital of Patras, Greece at 2021. Feel free construct the device, use it or contribute to the project. Questions and comments are welcome.

# Documentation

You will find documentation of construction and usage and photos under `Documentation/doc.md`.
