# Infant breath mechanical simulator

This project is about building, developing, documenting and using a mechanical breathing simulator. The device simulates airflow conditions observed in either normal infants or those experiencing respiratory diseases. Simulating airflows is used in laboratory conditions for research and experimentation in areas such as flow dynamics, neonatology and respiratory medicine. 

# Features
- High volume and flow accuracy
- Easily expandable in software and hardware (ex. child or adult volumes, advanced respiratory patterns, etc)
- Low construction cost using simple hardware equipment (ex. stepper motors, arduino, etc)

# Main modules
- The volume compartment consists of a calibration syringe for respiratory equipment
- Air flow is produced from a moving carriage by a stepper motor
- Arduino is used for software and data, with a simple interaction with computer's Serial Monitor 
- Some hardware parts are 3d printed, and based on [RepRap Prusa Interation 3](https://reprap.org/wiki/Prusa_i3)

# Documentation
You will find documentation for construction, configuration and usage under [Documentation/doc.md](https://github.com/arisberd/Infant-breath-mechanical-simulator/blob/main/Documentation/doc.md). 

# Version 0.3
This is a developing project, but fully functional on predefined settings. You may encounter problems while using new features or trying to modify functions.

# Contribution
This project started at Pediatric Pulmonology Department of University Hospital of Patras, Greece at 2021. Feel free construct the device, use it or contribute to the project. [Questions and comments](https://github.com/arisberd/Infant-breath-mechanical-simulator/issues) are welcome.
